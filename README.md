# Classification-Models
Three ML classification models are used to predict bicycle crash severity.     

The purpose of this project is to analyze the different possible causes of crashes and predict the likely severity of crashes using a dataset related to bicycle incidents in Austin, Texas from 2010 to 2017. The intention of this analysis is to provide recommendations for avoiding serious incidents and to select the best model for the City of Austin to use.   
Understanding the structure of our dataset and the underlying context is of utmost importance and priority. This dataset contains 2462 records and 16 fields with 11 categorical variables, 1 Boolean variable, and 4 numerical variables.

Logistic regression model, decision tree model and random forest model are used and compared by different metircs including feature importance, accuracy, mean average error, and model run time.
